# Project Plan

## Initial Backlog Ideas

- Keep a constant navigation bar across all pages and contact navigation from home navigation bar
- Update path bar for easy backwards navigation such as for Products/XLL Plus
- Making "You can find out more here" the link not just the "here"

- Consistent currency on the "Buy Now" Page
- Be able to leave reviews on the products
- Remove "Customer Support" area on the main page
- Merge "Product" page and "Buy Now Page"

- Select to see available products
- Customer support options
- Log-in/Register options are available on the home page

- The database stores the downloadables/executables
- The database stores the user information

- Be able to host from any server (not just Windows)
- Be able to login from any page, not just support page
- High security with user account
