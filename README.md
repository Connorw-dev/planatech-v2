# Plantech V2
A modern redevelopment of [Platech Solutions website](https://planatechsolutions.com), developed as part of CP3407 Advanced Software Engineering at James Cook University.

## Team & Roles
- Connor White
- Liam Eime
- Carl Estranero
- Justin Fagg

## Agile Process
Our project requirements are managed through [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Connorw-dev/projects/2/). We use this to:
- Track user stories and their priorities
- Assign story point estimates
- Organise stories into iterations
- Monitor development progress

- ### Team Velocity
Initial velocity calculation:
- Team size: 4 developers
- Working days per iteration: 2 days a week × 4 weeks = 8 days
- Initial velocity factor: 0.7 (conservative estimate for new team)
- Work capacity per iteration: 4 × 8 × 0.7 = 22.4 developer-days

This means our team can handle approximately 22 days worth of user story estimates per iteration.

User stories are organised into:
- Backlog (all potential features)
- Iteration 1 (4 weeks: Feb 17 - Mar 16)
- Iteration 2 (4 weeks: Mar 17 - Apr 13)

## Design
### Architectural Design
UML diagrams and explanations of major components (using online UML tool)

### Database Design
Database schema and relationships (using GenMyModel)

### Interface Design
UI/UX prototypes and design decisions (using NinjaMock)

## Implementation
- How we use GitHub/git for version control
- Key software development tools used
- External libraries and their purposes

## Testing
How we validate features against requirements, including:
- Test-driven development approach
- Acceptance testing process
- Testing datasets

## Deployment
Instructions for deploying and running the project
