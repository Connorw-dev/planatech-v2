Each story includes:
- Priority (10-50, with 10 being highest)
- Time estimate in days
- Assigned developer(s)
- Status tracking

## Agile Process
We use GitHub Projects as our primary project management tool to implement iterative development. Our board includes:
- User Stories (requirements tracking)
- In Progress (current development)
- Completed (finished work)
- Next (upcoming work)

## Deployment
Instructions for deploying and running the project
