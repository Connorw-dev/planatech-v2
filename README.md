# Plantech V2
A modern redevelopment of [Platech Solutions website](https://planatechsolutions.com), developed as part of CP3407 Advanced Software Engineering at James Cook University.

## Team & Roles
- Connor White
- Liam Eime
- Carl Estranero
- Justin Fagg

## Agile Process
Our project requirements are managed through [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Connorw-dev/projects/2/). We use this to:
- Track user stories and their priorities
- Assign story point estimates
- Organise stories into iterations
- Monitor development progress

- ### Team Velocity
Initial velocity calculation:
- Team size: 4 developers
- Working days per iteration: 2 days a week × 4 weeks = 8 days
- Initial velocity factor: 0.7 (conservative estimate for new team)
- Work capacity per iteration: 4 × 8 × 0.7 = 22.4 developer-days

This means our team can handle approximately 22 days worth of user story estimates per iteration.

User stories are organised into:
- Backlog (all potential features)
- Iteration 1 (4 weeks: Feb 17 - Mar 16)
- Iteration 2 (4 weeks: Mar 17 - Apr 13)

## Design
### Architectural Design
UML diagrams and explanations of major components (using online UML tool)

### Database Design
Database schema and relationships (using GenMyModel)

### Interface Design
UI/UX prototypes and design decisions (using NinjaMock)

## Implementation
- How we use GitHub/git for version control
- Key software development tools used
- External libraries and their purposes

## Testing
How we validate features against requirements, including:
- Test-driven development approach
- Acceptance testing process
- Testing datasets

## Deployment
Instructions for deploying and running the project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
